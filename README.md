# Bose-Einstein condensate in 3D Harmonic-Trap
Visualization of Bose Einstein Condensate in 3D Harmonic Trap using python package pyTALISES (This Ain't a LInear Schr√∂dinger Equation Solver) written by Sascha Vowe and Bastian Leykaf. 
In this notebook, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution method has been used along with the anisotropic harmonic oscillator to reduce the effect of higher energy states.
Then the trap is switched of and only interaction potential between the atoms was let to do its job when we achieve the aspect-ratio change.
